# Water Bottle Fallback Fix

## Issue Summary
The FreeCAD Manufacturing Co-Pilot server was experiencing a `NameError` when generating water bottle models using the fallback template. The error occurred because variables like `wall_thickness` and `actual_volume` were referenced in the error handling and response metadata sections but were not defined in the outer scope of the `text_to_cad` function.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Variables
Added the following variable definitions in the water bottle fallback section of the `text_to_cad` function:
- `wall_thickness = 2.0`  - Default wall thickness in mm
- `actual_volume = volume` - Set to match the requested volume
- Volume-related variables for error handling:
  - `body_volume = volume * 0.8` - Estimate for body volume (80% of total)
  - `transition_inner_volume = volume * 0.1` - Estimate for transition volume (10% of total)
  - `neck_inner_volume = volume * 0.1` - Estimate for neck volume (10% of total)

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Added better error handling to ensure the fallback template works even if volume extraction fails
- Added detailed debug prints to track the execution flow and variable values

### 3. Testing
- Updated and used the `debug_water_bottle.py` script to verify the fix
- Confirmed that the server now correctly generates water bottles with different volumes

## Current Capabilities
- The water bottle fallback template can generate bottles with different volumes (e.g., 500ml, 750ml)
- The volume is extracted from the prompt if specified (e.g., "Create a 500ml water bottle")
- Default volume of 750ml is used if not specified
- Fixed wall thickness of 2.0mm is used

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for the water bottle template:
- Add support for different neck widths
- Add support for different materials
- Add support for special features (e.g., measurement markings, textured grip)
- Improve the visual design of the bottle

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the server: `python3 unified_server_v2.py`
2. Test with the debug script: `python3 debug_water_bottle.py`
3. Or use the FreeCAD macro: Load `standalonecopilot.fcmacro` in FreeCAD and enter "Create a 500ml water bottle"
