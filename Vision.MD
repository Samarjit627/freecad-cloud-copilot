| CAD Metadata Extractor Agent | Parses dimensions, tolerances, features from 3D | Preps inputs for reasoning chain |

### Level 2: Supervisor Agents
Supervise clusters of worker agents, validate outputs, and summarize insights.

| Agent | Role | Worker Agents Managed | Enhancements |
|-------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| DFM Supervisor Agent | Validates manufacturability from all angles | DFM Rule Checker, Undercut Detector, Wall Agent, Overlay | Groups, filters, and prioritizes risks |
| Tolerance Supervisor Agent | Ensures tolerances are achievable and not over-engineered | Tolerance Verifier, Process Library | Flags unneeded precision or infeasible specs |

| Data Retriever Agent | Interfaces with the Knowledge Pool (books, handbooks) | Fetches citations, rules, and analogues | Used by all Supervisors |

### Level 3: Manager Agents
Decision makers that optimize across one functional track: DFM, Cost, Process, etc.

| Agent | Role | Supervisors Managed | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------------------|--------|
| DFM Manager Agent | Crafts final manufacturability feedback | DFM Supervisor, Tolerance Supervisor | Suggests fixes and confidence score |
| Cost Manager Agent | Determines best trade-offs for cost | Cost Supervisor, Tooling Supervisor | Simulates batch quantity effects |

| Report Compiler GM Agent | Creates final PDF/HTML manufacturing summary | Pulls from all GMs | Adds explanations, ghost overlay screenshots |

### Level 5: CEO Agent (Chief Orchestrator)
Strategic executive layer that runs the entire show — only 1.

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| CEO Agent (Mission Director) | Initiates the session, reads user intent, triggers all lower agents. Determines the sequence, reruns paths if conflicts arise, manages trade-offs (e.g., "optimize for cost" vs "preserve intent"), and delivers the final output to the user. Works in cycles: Planning → Execution → Reflection → Delivery. |

### Core Agentic Flow (Mass Production Example)
```
User uploads CAD → CEO Agent triggers

→ Intent Mapper Agent classifies purpose as Mass Production  
→ DFM Manager Agent checks manufacturability  
 → Supervisor checks wall thickness, tolerances, undercuts  
→ Cost Manager Agent simulates cost per quantity  
→ Tooling Supervisor estimates mold/tool needs  
→ Process Manager Agent ranks suitable processes  
→ Optimization GM balances speed vs cost vs tooling effort  
→ Version Control GM suggests V2 with draft angle fixes  
→ Report GM prepares manufacturing report  
→ CEO Agent reviews + delivers report and V2 output  
→ Session Memory GM stores all findings  
```

### Reflection + Evolution Layer (Future Enhancement)
| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Reflection Agent | Learns from skipped suggestions, user feedback, and acceptance rate. Updates scoring models in Fix/Cost/Process agents. |
| Improvement Agent | Suggests changes in agent workflows or weights (e.g., promote faster cost agent variant) |
| User Behavior Mapper | Clusters similar user paths to suggest smarter defaults over time |
