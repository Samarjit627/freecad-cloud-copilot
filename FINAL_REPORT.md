# FreeCAD Manufacturing Co-Pilot Unified Server - Final Report

## Project Overview

This report documents the resolution of compatibility issues that prevented the FreeCAD Manufacturing Co-Pilot unified server from running on Python 3.12/3.13. The primary goal was to upgrade FastAPI and Pydantic to compatible versions, fix related code changes for Pydantic v2, and ensure both DFM analysis and Text-to-CAD features function correctly from a single unified server.

## Problem Summary

The original unified server implementation was encountering the following error when running on Python 3.12/3.13:

```
TypeError: ForwardRef._evaluate() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'recursive_guard'
```

This error occurred due to incompatibility between older versions of FastAPI/Pydantic and the newer Python versions, specifically:
- FastAPI 0.95.2
- Pydantic 1.10.8
- Uvicorn 0.22.0

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: New Unified Server Implementation

We created a completely new unified server implementation (`unified_server_v2.py`) that is compatible with Python 3.12/3.13 and Pydantic v2. This implementation:

1. Uses the latest versions of FastAPI, Pydantic, and Uvicorn
2. Implements both DFM analysis and Text-to-CAD endpoints
3. Uses Pydantic v2 compatible methods (e.g., `model_dump()` instead of `dict()`)
4. Runs on port 8084 to avoid conflicts

### Solution 2: Updated Original Unified Server

We also updated the original unified server implementation to be compatible with Python 3.12/3.13 and Pydantic v2. This involved:

1. Updating the routers to use Pydantic v2 compatible methods
2. Creating a new requirements.txt file with compatible package versions
3. Providing a script to run the updated original unified server

### Solution 3: Unified Start/Stop Scripts

We created unified scripts to start and stop all services with a single command:

1. `start_all_services.sh`: Starts both the unified server and local proxy server
2. `stop_all_services.sh`: Stops both services

## Technical Details

### Updated Dependencies

```
fastapi>=0.115.0
pydantic>=2.8.0
uvicorn>=0.24.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
requests>=2.30.0
```

### Pydantic v2 Migration Changes

The following changes were made to ensure compatibility with Pydantic v2:

| Pydantic v1 | Pydantic v2 |
|-------------|-------------|
| `BaseModel.dict()` | `BaseModel.model_dump()` |
| `BaseModel.json()` | `BaseModel.model_dump_json()` |
| `BaseModel.parse_obj()` | `BaseModel.model_validate()` |
| `BaseModel.parse_raw()` | `BaseModel.model_validate_json()` |

### Server Endpoints

#### Unified Server (Port 8084)

- Health: `GET http://localhost:8084/health`
- DFM Analysis: `POST http://localhost:8084/api/v2/analyze`
- Text-to-CAD: `POST http://localhost:8084/api/v1/text-to-cad`

#### Local Proxy Server (Port 8090)

- Health: `GET http://localhost:8090/health`
- DFM Analysis: `POST http://localhost:8090/api/v2/analyze`
- Text-to-CAD: `POST http://localhost:8090/api/v1/text-to-cad`

## Usage Instructions

### Option 1: Using the New Unified Server

1. Start the unified server:
   ```bash
   ./run_unified_server_v2.sh
   ```

2. Start the local proxy server:
   ```bash
   ./start_local_server.sh
   ```

### Option 2: Using the Updated Original Unified Server

1. Start the updated original unified server:
   ```bash
   ./run_original_unified_server.sh
   ```

2. Start the local proxy server:
   ```bash
   ./start_local_server.sh
   ```

### Option 3: Using the Unified Start/Stop Scripts

1. Start all services:
   ```bash
   ./start_all_services.sh
   ```

2. Stop all services:
   ```bash
   ./stop_all_services.sh
   ```

### Testing the Services

To verify that both endpoints are working correctly:

```bash
python test_endpoints.py
```

## Project Files

## Conclusion

The compatibility issues preventing the FreeCAD Manufacturing Co-Pilot unified server from running on Python 3.12/3.13 have been successfully resolved. Both DFM analysis and Text-to-CAD features now function correctly from a single unified server without fallback reliance.

The solution provides multiple options for running the unified server, allowing flexibility based on specific needs. All endpoints are properly authenticated and the system is now fully compatible with the latest Python versions.

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider containerizing the application with Docker to ensure consistent environments
2. Implement more robust error handling and logging
3. Add unit tests for the unified server implementation
4. Implement a more sophisticated fallback mechanism for the local proxy server
5. Consider adding a web-based UI for easier interaction with the unified server
